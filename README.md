# RipBox GUI

A minimalist, web-based GUI for building reliable and repeatable `HandBrakeCLI` commands to rip DVDs for archival, media servers, or personal collections.

This tool is designed for users running **Linux-based home media servers (e.g., Jellyfin setups)** who want a quick and human-friendly interface to generate correct CLI commands with consistent output structure, subtitles, and folder organization.

---

## Features

- 🖥️ **Simple single-page web app** — no backend required, runs locally in any modern browser.
- 📝 **Auto-build `mkdir`, `HandBrakeCLI`, and `ffprobe` commands** ready to paste into your terminal.
- 🔤 **Optional subtitle track selection** — define subtitle tracks if needed.
- 🔒 **No burn-in subtitles by default** — subtitles embedded as selectable tracks if present.
- 📋 **One-click copy buttons** with tooltip feedback.

---

## Why?

Manually preparing consistent `HandBrakeCLI` commands can be repetitive and error-prone, especially when ensuring:

- Proper subtitle handling
- Reliable command syntax
- Consistent folder structure for movies

This project provides a lightweight, fast, and shareable workflow assistant so you can focus on efficient ripping and enjoy your media collection faster.

## Getting the DVD Name

For consistency and better metadata matching in media servers like Jellyfin, it’s worth searching for the correct title and year on a trusted source such as **IMDB** or **The Movie Database (TMDb)**.

✅ Example workflow:
1️⃣ Search for the film or series on [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com) or [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org).  
2️⃣ Copy the official title exactly as shown, including the year in parentheses — e.g., `Batman & Robin (1997)`.  
3️⃣ Paste this value directly into the **DVD Name** field of the GUI.

This ensures reliable matching during metadata scans.

## Usage

1️⃣ Clone or download this repo:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ripbox-gui.git
```

2️⃣ Open the GUI:  
Simply open the `index.html` file directly in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).  
No server, dependencies, or build tools are required — it works completely client-side.

3️⃣ Fill in:
- Name (e.g., `The Terminator (1984)`)
- DVD Title number
- Optional subtitle tracks
  (If no subtitle track selection is provided, subtitles will not be included in the generated command)

4️⃣ Copy and paste the generated commands directly into your terminal for execution on your media server.

## Known issues with subtitles on older DVDs

Not related to this project at all, but something to be aware of:

Many older DVDs use bitmap-based subtitle tracks (VOBSUB), and their structure can vary widely between discs:

- Some contain multiple redundant subtitle tracks (e.g., "Wide Screen", "Letterbox") that require manual inspection.
- Some lack proper language tags or subtitle flags.
- HandBrakeCLI’s `--subtitle-lang-list eng --all-subtitles` works well for most modern discs but may fail or behave unexpectedly on older titles.
- If subtitle tracks aren’t properly flagged on the disc, subtitles may not be embedded automatically even if they exist.

**Recommendation:**  
Before ripping older discs, run a title scan first:

```bash
HandBrakeCLI -i /dev/sr0 -t 0 --min-duration 300
```

Then review subtitle track numbers manually and adjust your `--subtitle` options accordingly in the generated rip command.
