# RipBox GUI

A minimalist, web-based GUI for building reliable and repeatable `HandBrakeCLI` commands to rip DVDs for archival, media servers, or personal collections.

This tool is designed for users running **Linux-based home media servers (e.g., Jellyfin setups)** who want a quick and human-friendly interface to generate correct CLI commands with consistent output structure, subtitles, and folder organization.

## Features

- üñ•Ô∏è **Simple single-page web app** ‚Äî no backend required, runs locally in any modern browser.
- üìù **Auto-build `mkdir`, `HandBrakeCLI`, and `ffprobe` commands** ready to paste into your terminal.
- üî§ **Optional subtitle track selection** ‚Äî define subtitle tracks if needed.
- üîí **No burn-in subtitles by default** ‚Äî subtitles embedded as selectable tracks if present.
- üìã **One-click copy buttons** with tooltip feedback.

## Why?

Manually preparing consistent `HandBrakeCLI` commands can be repetitive and error-prone, especially when ensuring:

- Proper subtitle handling
- Reliable command syntax
- Consistent folder structure for movies

This project provides a lightweight, fast, and shareable workflow assistant so you can focus on efficient ripping and enjoy your media collection faster.

## Getting the DVD Name

For consistency and better metadata matching in media servers like Jellyfin, it‚Äôs worth searching for the correct title and year on a trusted source such as **IMDB** or **The Movie Database (TMDb)**.

‚úÖ Example workflow:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Search for the film or series on [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com) or [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Copy the official title exactly as shown, including the year in parentheses ‚Äî e.g., `Batman & Robin (1997)`.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Paste this value directly into the **DVD Name** field of the GUI.

This ensures reliable matching during metadata scans.

## Usage

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone or download this repo:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/seemly/ripbox-gui.git
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Open the GUI:  
Simply open the `index.html` file directly in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).  
No server, dependencies, or build tools are required ‚Äî it works completely client-side.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Fill in:
- Name (e.g., `The Terminator (1984)`)
- DVD Title number
- Optional subtitle tracks
  (If no subtitle track selection is provided, subtitles will not be included in the generated command)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Copy and paste the generated commands directly into your terminal for execution on your media server.

## Known issues with subtitles on older DVDs

Not related to this project at all, but something to be aware of:

Many older DVDs use bitmap-based subtitle tracks (VOBSUB), and their structure can vary widely between discs:

- Some contain multiple redundant subtitle tracks (e.g., "Wide Screen", "Letterbox") that require manual inspection.
- Some lack proper language tags or subtitle flags.
- HandBrakeCLI‚Äôs `--subtitle-lang-list eng --all-subtitles` works well for most modern discs but may fail or behave unexpectedly on older titles.
- If subtitle tracks aren‚Äôt properly flagged on the disc, subtitles may not be embedded automatically even if they exist.

**Recommendation:**  
Before ripping older discs, run a title scan first:

```bash
HandBrakeCLI -i /dev/sr0 -t 0 --min-duration 300
```

Then review subtitle track numbers manually and adjust your `--subtitle` options accordingly in the generated rip command.
